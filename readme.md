### A suite of analysis tools for investigating yeast behavior under nitrogen-limited conditions

The Yeaz Output Analysis package is a collection of tools designed to aid the analysis of microscopy images of yeast cells. Specifically, it is designed to process nd2 files combined with the output segmentation mask h5 file provided by [YeaZ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19557-4), a software tool that allows the segmentation of yeast cells in microscopy images. The package provides a convenient way to process the intracellular localization of the green fluorescent channel of the nd2 file using the segmentation file generated by YeaZ.

### Repository Organization
The Yeaz Output Analysis repository is organized into several folders:

- **Pipeline:** This folder includes files relating to the characterization of the two subpopulations that form under yeast nitrogen limitation and the differences in transcription factor activity between them.
- **Z_analysis**: This folder is related to the isolation of the peak fluorescence localization score for cells that have been imaged in multiple Z-stack planes.
- **Highlight Cells**: This folder is used to annotate the original nd2 file with colored outlines corresponding to cells belonging to each of the two subpopulations, providing a visual inspection of the subpopulation characterization.
- **Flow Data Analysis**: This folder inspects the accuracy of the pipeline being used as a flow cytometer replacement. It compares FACS data with microscopy data for size and mean red fluorescence.
- **Tracking Analysis**: This folder includes files relating to the temporal behavior of each subpopulation, looking into the division and growth rate of each subpopulation with time.
### Repository Housekeeping
This repository is formatted with [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a Python formatter that helps maintain code readability and consistency. It is used to ensure that code is formatted consistently throughout the repository.
